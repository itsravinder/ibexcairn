# Skill: Runtime Validation and Testing

> **Purpose**: Authoritative rules for validating and testing converted Logic Apps Standard projects. Follow exactly.

---

## 1. Runtime Validation

- Run `func start --verbose` in the generated project folder.
- Check for errors in the output.
- Fix any issues found (bad connections, missing settings, schema errors).
- Re-run until the runtime starts cleanly with no errors.

---

## 2. Local E2E Test Matrix

Test ALL workflows end-to-end locally. Run EVERY scenario:

1. **Happy path** — valid input, expected successful output.
2. **Error/failure path** — invalid or malformed input, verify error handling works.
3. **Cross-workflow chain** — if workflow A triggers workflow B, test the ENTIRE chain.
4. **Timeout/retry path** — if any workflow has timeout or retry logic, test it.
5. **Resubmission path** — if the flow supports message resubmission, test it.
6. **SplitOn check** — if any trigger returns an array and uses a `For_each` loop instead of `splitOn`, refactor to use `splitOn` and re-test.

Trigger each workflow based on trigger type:

- HTTP → `curl` / `Invoke-WebRequest`
- File → place file in `mountPath`
- Service Bus → send message
- Timer → check logs

If a workflow fails, fix the issue and re-test until all scenarios pass.

## 2a. Output Content Validation

Workflow completion (status = Succeeded) is NOT sufficient. For every output produced during E2E testing, perform **field-level content validation**:

1. **Parse every output file/message** — read the actual XML/JSON content produced by each workflow action that writes to an external destination (file, HTTP response, queue message).
2. **Verify non-empty fields** — every element/property that should carry a value from the source message MUST be non-empty. Flag any empty elements that should contain propagated data.
3. **Verify value propagation** — trace key business fields (IDs, amounts, dates, counts) from input through every transformation to output. Confirm the correct value appears at each stage.
4. **Verify constant/static values** — check that hardcoded values (status codes, acknowledgment strings, booleans) match the expected constants from the source orchestration logic.
5. **Verify collection preservation** — if the source message contains repeating elements (arrays/lists), confirm all items survive through mass-copy/pass-through transforms (not just the first item).
6. **Compare against source behavior** — determine what the source platform (BizTalk, MuleSoft, TIBCO, etc.) would produce for the same input, and verify the migrated Logic App produces semantically equivalent output.

If any field is empty, truncated, or contains the wrong value, treat it as a **test failure** even if the workflow status is Succeeded. Fix the root cause (wrong action input, incorrect XSLT XPath, missing mapping) and re-test.

---

## 3. Test Adaptation Rules

- NEVER skip tests due to long delays, timers, retry intervals, or timeouts.
- Instead, temporarily reduce these values to test-friendly durations (seconds instead of hours).
- Run all tests.
- Then REVERT to original production values after testing.
- Document all adaptations and reversions in the test report.

---

## 4. No Source Platform Infrastructure

During testing, NEVER connect to or use original source platform infrastructure (on-premises SQL servers, file shares, message queues, FTP servers, etc.).

- For local-capable connectors (File System, HTTP, Timer) → use LOCAL resources.
- For cloud-only connectors (Service Bus, Event Hubs, etc.) → use ONLY Azure resources provisioned in the configured resource group.
- Ensure Azurite is running before `func start` (`AzureWebJobsStorage` uses `UseDevelopmentStorage=true`).

---

## 5. Local-First Resource Strategy

- Use Azurite (`UseDevelopmentStorage=true`) for `AzureWebJobsStorage`.
- Use local file paths for File System connector `mountPath`.
- Use `localhost` for HTTP triggers.
- For SQL Server, Cosmos DB, SFTP, PostgreSQL, MySQL → use Docker containers.
- Check Docker availability with `docker --version`.
- Only provision Azure resources for connectors with NO local/Docker alternative (Service Bus, Event Hubs, Integration Account).

---

## 6. TEST-REPORT.md

After testing, generate `TEST-REPORT.md` in the project root with:

- This report is MANDATORY. Do NOT consider the local testing task complete until `TEST-REPORT.md` has been created and populated.

- Test results per workflow.
- **Output content validation results** — for each output file/message, list every validated field with expected vs actual value and PASS/FAIL status. Include a summary count of field-level checks.
- Azure resources provisioned.
- Adjustments made during testing.
- Design deviations from plan (should be none — see plan adherence).
- Deployment notes.
- Re-test instructions with exact commands.

---

## 7. Completion Gate

Do NOT call `migration_conversion_finalize` until ALL tests pass and `TEST-REPORT.md` exists. The delivered workspace MUST be fully working with zero manual setup.
